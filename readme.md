## Configuring

If you want to configure the resource. To add jobs or change language then i have made a short guide below.

Adding jobs:

- Head into the folder where the resource is located
- Open config.lua
- Find the jobs table

```lua
Config.jobs = {
    {job = 'garbage', label = 'Garbage job'},
    {job = 'police', label = 'Police job'},
    {job = 'ems', label = 'Mechanic job'},
    {job = 'mechanic', label = 'Mechanic job'},
}
```

- Add a new line and insert this:

`{job = 'job', label = 'Job label'},`

- Replace 'job' with the job name from the databse
- Replace 'Job label' with the text you wanna have shown in the jobcenter menu.
- You are now done
- You can add as many jobs in as you want but alot may confuse players.

Adding a new language:

- Head into the folder where the resource is located.
- Locate the `locales` folder and enter.
